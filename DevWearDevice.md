### Development of Wearable Cardio-Respiratory Monitoring Device (BSc.  final year project)
The project focused on contactless measurement of heart rate and respiration patterns based on reï¬‚ective Photoplethysmography and magnetic induction (MI) coupling principle, respectively. It features a non-invasive, non-irritating, and wireless method for home motioning of patients.
