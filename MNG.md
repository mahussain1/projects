### Measurement Network Gateway
In this project, a temperature measurement network gateway is developed using Xilinx's Zedoard. Program senses and samples data from diï¬€erent sensors and sends it to the remote device over the network. Along with this, it also sends information of the time when the temperature was recorded for each sensor. CANopen protocol is implemented to interface the CANopen device to read the temperature and send the packet over the network using TCP/IP protocol. An embedded Linux application running on Xilinx's Zedboard acts as a server while the remote network works as a client.
